**INSTALLATION**
<br>
It is necessary to create a database called test with the following parameters:
<br>
**servername = "localhost"**
<br>
**username = "root"**
<br>
**password = ""**
<br>
Or change setting on file /db/connectionDB.php
<br>
When you go to the page '/seed.php', the seeder will create the necessary tables, if they don't exist.
<br>
That's all, application ready to work!
